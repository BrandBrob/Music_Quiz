const lyric =[`I'm sitting here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder`,
`I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waiting for you
`,`
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree`,`I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree`,`Sing!
I'm sitting here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
While nothing ever happens and I wonder`,`Isolation is not good for me
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
I'm stepping around in the desert of joy
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder`,`I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree`,`I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder, wonder`,`I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see, and all that I can see, and all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree`]
